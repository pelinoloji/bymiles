## About The Project

After I read the details about the task - which was provided very clearly - I tried to get the data using Postman. After I managed to get the result I started to build the task.

I checked [your website]('https://www.bymiles.co.uk/') and looked which tech do you use then I saw Next.js that's why I used Next.js. Another reason for that, I have been learning Next.js these days, and I found it would be a nice opportunity to use it as well.

I have struggled about getInitialProps structure a little bit but managed to sort it out.

I'm following the tech stacks and I have been keep reading some libraries such as Formik and Yup lately, that's why I wanted to used them for validation and form submit.

For design, I used CSS and I didn't add anything more as written in the task.

For estimation, I would say the project took about more than half of my day.
